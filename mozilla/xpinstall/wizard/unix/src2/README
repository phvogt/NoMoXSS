                 Mozilla Read Me

====================================================

Mozilla is subject to the terms detailed in the license agreement accompanying it.

This Read Me file contains information about system requirements and installation instructions for the Linux builds of Mozilla. 

For more info on Mozilla, see www.mozilla.org. To submit bugs or other feedback, see the Navigator QA menu and check out Bugzilla at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ for links to known bugs, bug-writing guidelines, and more. You can also get help with Bugzilla by pointing your IRC client to #mozillazine at irc.mozilla.org.

                 Getting Mozilla

====================================================

You can download nightly builds of Mozilla from the Mozilla.org FTP site at

  http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly/

For the very latest builds, see

  http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/nightly/latest/

Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by Mozilla.org developers for testing, may be buggy. If you are looking for a more polished version of Mozilla, Mozilla.org releases Milestone builds of Mozilla every six weeks or so that you can download from

  http://www.mozilla.org/releases/
 
Be sure to read the Mozilla release notes for information on known problems and installation issues with Mozilla.  The release notes can be found at the preceding URL along with the milestone releases themselves.

Note: Please use Talkback builds whenever possible. These builds allow transmission of crash data back to Mozilla developers, improved crash analysis, and posting of crash information to our crash-data newsgroup.


====================================================

               System Requirements

====================================================

-The following library versions (or compatible) are required: glibc 2.2.4, XFree86 3.3.x, GTK 1.2.x, Glib 1.2.x, Libstdc++ 2.9.0. Red Hat Linux 7.0, Debian 3.0, and SuSE 7.3 (or later) installations should work.

            Installation Instructions

====================================================

Note that the installation instructions use the bash shell. If you're not using bash, adjust the commands accordingly.

Install into a clean (new) directory.  Installing on top of previously released builds may cause problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build Mozilla.  For info on building the Mozilla source, see

  http://www.mozilla.org/source.html


Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

Note: If you install in the default directory (which is usually /usr/local/mozilla), or any other directory where only the root user normally has write-access, you must start Mozilla first as root before other users can start the program. Doing so generates a set of files required for later use by other users.  However, do not use sudo to run the installer as root because that can damage your profile.


To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory named mozilla (mkdir mozilla) and change to that directory (cd mozilla).
	
2. Click the link on the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download the installer file (called mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-installer.tar.gz) to your machine.

3. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and decompress the archive with the following command:

  tar zxvf moz*.tar.gz

The installer is now located in a subdirectory of Mozilla named mozilla-installer.

4. Change to the mozilla-installer directory (cd mozilla-installer) and run the installer with the ./mozilla-installer command.

5. Follow the instructions in the install wizard for installing Mozilla.

Note: If you have a slower machine, be aware that the installation may take some time. In this case, the installation progress may appear to hang indefinitely, even though the installation is still in process.

6. To start Mozilla, change to the directory where you installed it and run the ./mozilla command.


To install Mozilla by downloading the tar.gz file:

1. Create a directory named "mozilla" (mkdir mozilla) and change to that directory (cd mozilla).

2. Click the link on the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download the non-installer (mozilla*.tar.gz) file into the mozilla directory.

3. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and decompress the file with the following command:

  tar zxvf moz*.tar.gz
	
This creates a "mozilla" directory under your mozilla directory. 

4. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla). 

5. Run Mozilla with the following run script: 

  ./mozilla


To hook up Mozilla complete with icon to the GNOME Panel, follow these steps:

1. Click the GNOME Main Menu button, open the Panel menu, and then open the Add to Panel submenu and choose Launcher.

2. Right-click the icon for Mozilla on the Panel and enter the following command:
  directory_name./mozilla

where directory_name is the name of the directory you downloaded mozilla to. For example, the default directory that Mozilla suggests is /usr/local/mozilla.

3. Type in a name for the icon, and type in a comment if you wish.

4. Click the icon button and type in the following as the icon's location:

  directory_name/icons/mozicon50.xpm

where directory name is the directory where you installed Mozilla. For example, the default directory is /usr/local/mozilla/icons/mozicon50.xpm.
