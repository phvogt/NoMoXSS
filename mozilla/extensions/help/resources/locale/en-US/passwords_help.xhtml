<h3>Password Manager</h3>

<p>Password Manager preferences allow you to
<ul>
<li><b>Remember passwords:</b> Select this checkbox to turn Password Manager on, so that it asks to store your user names and passwords at appropriate times and enters them for you automatically when they're requested. To turn off Password Manager, deselect the same checkbox.
<li><b>Manage Stored Passwords:</b> Click this button to manage information about your stored passwords and the sites whose user names and passwords you don't want to be stored.
</ul> 

<p>For detailed information about using Password Manager, including how to override it for individual sites and how to view and manage stored passwords, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#using_password">Using the Password Manager</a>.

<a NAME="Encrypting_Versus_Obscuring"></a>
<h3>Encrypting Versus Obscuring</h3>

<p>If you use Password Manager or Form Manager to save passwords and personal data, this sensitive information is stored on your computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read. This way of storing information is sometimes described as &quot;obscuring.&quot; This is the default setting that applies to information stored by Password Manager or Form Manager.

<p>For improved protection, you may choose to protect the file with encryption. Encryption makes it more difficult (but again, not impossible) for an unauthorized person to view your stored sensitive information.


<ul><li><b>Use encryption when storing sensitive data:</b> Select this checkbox to turn on encryption, or deselect it to turn off encryption.</ul> 

<p>If you have not previously set a <a href="glossary.html#master_password">master password</a>, you will be asked to create one. To do so, follow the instructions as they appear on your screen. 

<p>Using encryption versus obscuring for stored sensitive data is a tradeoff between improved security and convenience:

<ul>
	<li>If you use encryption, you will need to enter a master password periodically, which can be inconvenient. (For information about controlling how often it is requested, see the discussion of the Master Password timeout at <a href="#Master_Password_Timeout">Privacy &amp; Security Preferences - Master Passwords</a>.) 
	<li>If you use obscuring, you may not have to set a master password at all (unless you're using certificates for identification purposes), but it may be easier for a stranger who has access to your computer to steal your passwords.
</ul>

<p>For more details, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#using_encrypt">Encrypting Stored Sensitive Information</a>.

<h2>Password Manager</h2>

<p>This section describes how to use Password Manager dialog box to control your stored passwords. If you are not already viewing it, follow these steps:
<ol>
	<li>Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
   	<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Passwords. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
	<li>Click Manage Stored Passwords.
</ol>

<p>The Password Manager has two tabs:

<ul>
	<li><b>Passwords Saved:</b> Click this tab to view the list of sites for which Password Manager has saved your user name and password&amp;that is, the sites for which you selected &quot;Yes&quot; in response to Password Manager&apos;s request to store logon information. 

	<p>The second column shows the user name for each site. If the password is stored in encrypted form, &quot;(encrypted)&quot; appears after the user name. (The stored passwords themselves are not displayed.) 

	<p>If you remove an entry from the list, the stored user name and password will be discarded, and you will need to log in manually the next time you visit that site.

	<li><b>Passwords Never Saved:</b>  Click this tab to view the list of sites for which you selected "Never for this site" in response to Password Manager&apos;s request to store logon information. 

	<p>If a site is included on this list, you must always type in your user name and password manually when you log onto this site. 

	<p>If you remove an entry from this list, Password Manager will again ask you, the next time you log onto the site, whether to store your user name and password.

</ul>

<p>Regardless of which tab you are viewing, you can remove entries from the list as follows:

<ul>

	<li><b>Remove:</b> Select one or more entries that you want to remove, then click Remove. 
	<li><b>Remove All:</b> Click this button to remove all the entries listed in the tab you are viewing.

</ul>

<h3>Change Master Password</h3>

<p>A master password protects a security device, which is a software or hardware device that stores sensitive information associated with your identity, such as keys or certificates. 

<p>For example, the browser has a built-in Software Security Device, and you can also use external security devices, such as smart cards, if your computer is configured to use them.

<p>The master password for the browser's built-in Software Security Device also protects stored sensitive information such as email passwords, web site passwords, and other data stored by the Password Manager and Form Manager. 

<ul><li><p><b>Change Password:</b> Click this button to set or change any of your master passwords. For information about using the Change Master Password dialog box that appears when you click this button, see <a href="#Change_Master_Password">Change Master Password</a>.</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="Master_Password"></a>
<a NAME="master_password:timeout_forIDX"></a>

<h3>Master Password Timeout</h3>


<p>After you first set a new master password, you will be asked to enter it only when the newly launched browser first needs it to access personal information, such as a user name and password, saved form data, or personal certificates.

<p>You can control how often the browser requests your master password:

<ul>
	<LI><B>The first time it is needed.</B> This setting (selected by default) causes the browser to request your master password only the first time it needs access to the private key database after launching. The browser will not request the master password again until after you exit and relaunch it. This setting provides the lowest level of protection.

	<LI><B>Every time it is needed.</B> This setting ensures that the browser will never access your saved personal information without first requesting your master password. This setting provides the highest level of protection.

	<LI><B>If it has not been used for __ minutes or longer.</B> This setting causes the browser to request your master password if it needs to access your personal information and the specified interval has elapsed since the last time it did so.

</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="reset_mp_prefs"></a>
<h3>Reset Master Password</h3>

<p><b>Warning:</b> If you reset your master password, you will permanently erase all the encrypted web passwords, email passwords, and form data saved on your behalf by Password Manager and Form Manager. You will also lose all your personal certificates associated with the <a href="glossary.html#software_security_device">Software Security Device</a>. 

<p>Note that encrypted passwords and form data will be lost only if you have turned on encryption for this stored information. For information about turning encryption on or off, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#encrypt_on">Turning Encryption On and Off</a>. 

<p>To change your master password rather than resetting it, click the Change Password button in the Master Passwords preferences panel. 

<p>You must remember your old master password to change it with the Change Password button. 

<p>If you are really sure that you want to reset your master password and permanently erase all your encrypted personal information and certificates:

<ul><li><p><b>Reset Master Password:</b> Click this button to reset the master password for the Software Security Device. For more information, see <a href="#Reset_Master_Password">Reset Master Password</a>.</ul>

<h2>Change Master Password</h2>


<p>This section describes the Change Master Password dialog box. If you're not already viewing it, follow these steps:

<ol>
	<li>Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
	<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Master Passwords. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
	<li>Click Change Password.
</ol>

<p>A master password protects a security device, which is a software or hardware device that stores sensitive information associated with your identity, such as keys or certificates. 

<p>For example, the browser has a built-in Software Security Device, and you can also use external security devices, such as smart cards, if your computer is configured to use them.

<p>The master password for the browser's built-in Software Security Device also protects your master key. Your master key is used to encrypt sensitive information such as email passwords, web site passwords, and other data stored by the Password Manager and Form Manager. 

<p>You use the Change Master Password dialog box to provide the following information:

<ul>
<li><b>Security Device:</b> Each security device requires a separate master password. For example, if you are using one or more smart cards to store some of your certificates, you should set a separate master password for each one. If more than one security device is available, a drop-down list at the top of the Set Master Password dialog box allows you to choose the device whose password you want to change.</P>

<li><b>Current password:</b> If you are changing an existing master password, you must first type the current password. If you don't type the current password correctly, you will see the message "You did not enter  the current correct Master Password" after you click OK. If this happens, you must retype your current password.

<li><b>New password:</b> Type your new password into this field.

<li><b>New password (again):</b> Type your new password again. If you don't type it the second time exactly as you did the first time, the OK button remains inactive. If this happens, try typing the new password again. 

</ul>

<p>If someone uses your computer who knows or can guess your master password, that person may be able to access web sites while pretending to be you. This can be dangerous&mdash;for example, if you manage your financial accounts over the Internet. 

<p>Therefore, it's important to select a master password that's difficult to guess. The <b>password quality meter</b> gives you a rough idea of the quality of your password as you type it based on factors such as length and the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It does not guarantee, however, that no one will be able to guess your password.

<p>For further guidelines, see the online document <a href="http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/passwords.html" TARGET="_blank">Choosing a Good Password</a>. 

<p>It's also important to record your master password in a safe place&mdash;and<b> not </b>anywhere that's easily accessible to someone else. If you forget this password, you may not be able to access important information, such as web sites that require passwords or certificates stored on your computer. </P>

<h2>Reset Master Password</h2>


<p>This section describes the Reset Master Password dialog box. If you're not already viewing it, follow these steps:

<ol>
	<li>Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X) and choose Preferences.
	<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Master Passwords. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
	<li>Click Reset Password.
</ol>

<p><b>Warning:</b> If you reset your master password, you will permanently erase all encrypted web passwords, email passwords, and form data saved on your behalf by Password Manager and Form Manager. You will also lose all your personal certificates associated with the <a href="glossary.html#software_security_device">software security device</a>. 

<p>Encrypted passwords and form data will be lost only if you have turned on encryption for this stored information. For information about turning encryption on or off, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#encrypt_on">Turning Encryption On and Off</a>. 

<p>If you remember your master password and decide to change it, you can do so without danger of losing any personal information. If you are viewing the Reset Master Password alert and you decide you want to change your password rather than resetting it, click Cancel to return to the Master Passwords preferences panel, then click Change Password. For details, see <a href="#Change_Master_Password">Change Master Password</a>. 

<p>Resetting your master password is a last resort that you should use only if you are absolutely sure you've forgotten it. The seriousness of the situation depends on how much personal data your forgotten master password protects.  

<p>Resetting your master password does not create a new password. Instead, it removes all the data your old master password protects. You will be asked to specify a new master password the next time the browser needs to store personal information.

<p>After you reset your master password, you may also want to re-save personal information that you want to have prefilled in the future. For example, as you browse you may want Password Manager to save web site and email passwords again. 

<p>You will also need to enter data by hand until Form Manager accumulates enough data to fill in forms automatically. In addition, any personal certificates associated with the software security device will be permanently erased and you will need to apply for new ones.

<p><b>Note for smart card users:</b> Each smart card has its own master password. The master password for a smart card protects only the data on that smart card (such as personal certificates). You can normally change the master password for a smart card (assuming that you remember it), but you cannot reset it.
