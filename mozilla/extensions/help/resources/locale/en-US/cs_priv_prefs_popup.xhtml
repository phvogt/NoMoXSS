<h1>Controlling Popups</h1>
<p><b>What are Popups?</b></p>
<p>Pop-up windows, or popups, are windows that appear automatically and 
without your permission. They vary in size, but usually don't cover the whole 
screen. Some popups open on top of the current Navigator window, thus popping 
up,while others appear underneath Navigator (popunders).</p>
<p>Mozilla allows you to control both popups and 
popunders through the <a href="#popup_prefs">Popup Windows preferences 
panel</a>. Since popup blocking is turned off by default, you must enable it to prevent popups from appearing in Navigator.
<p>When blocking a popup, Mozilla can be set up to play a sound, 
as well as display an icon <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png"> 
in the status bar. You can use this icon to add a web site you're viewing to 
an exceptions list so that the site is allowed to again display popups.</p>
<p><b>Blocking popups may interfere with some web sites</b>: Some web sites, 
including some banking sites, use popups for important features. Blocking 
all popups disables such features. To allow specific web sites to 
use popups, while blocking all others, you can add specific web sites to the 
list of allowed sites. For more information, see <a href="#popup_prefs">Privacy &amp; 

Security Preferences - Popup Windows</a>.</p>
<p><b>Blocking popups doesn't always work</b>: Although Mozilla blocks 
most popups, some web sites, even when blocked, may use other methods to show 
popups.</p>
<p><b>Allowing popups from certain web sites</b>: After you've enabled popup blocking, you can still allow specific sites to display popups. Browse to the web site, and then from the Tools menu, choose Popup Manager, and then choose Allow Popups From This Site.</p>

<p>The next section describes how to control popups through preferences and through 
the popup control icon.</p>

<h2>Privacy &amp; Security Preferences - Popup Windows</h2>

<li><b>Allowed Sites: </b>Click this to view and edit the list of web sites that you want to allow to display popups. </li>
<ul>

<h3>When a popup window has been blocked</h3>
<ul>
<li>

a popup, select this option and type the location of the sound file. </p>

</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Select</b>: Click this to choose a sound file instead of typing its location 
in the field.</li>
<li><b>Preview</b>: Click this to listen to the chosen sound.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Display an icon in the Navigator status bar</b>: Select this to display 
an icon <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png"> in the Navigator status 
bar to indicate that a popup is blocked.<br>
<b>&nbsp;<br>
Note</b>: After the popup control icon <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png"> 

appears, it remains visible until you visit another web site. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Using the popup control icon to add allowed web sites</b>: You can use 
the popup control icon to quickly add a web site to the list of allowed web sites. Click the icon <img src="chrome://navigator/skin/icons/popup-blocked.png"> to open the list of allowed web sites. The current web site is already filled in. Click Add and then click OK to confirm your addition.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Blocking popups may not always work and may interfere with 
some web sites. For more information about blocking popups, see <a href="#blocking_popups">Controlling 
Popups</a>.</p>
