<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>

<p><b id="authentication">authentication.</b>&nbsp; The use of a password,
  certificate, personal identification number (PIN), or other information to
  validate an identity over a computer network. See also
  <a href="#password-based_authentication">password-based authentication</a>,
  <a href="#certificate-based_authentication">certificate-based authentication</a>,
  <a href="#client_authentication">client authentication</a>,
  <a href="#server_authentication">server authentication</a>.</p>

<p><b id="bookmark">bookmark.</b>&nbsp;A stored web page address (<a href="#Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a>)
  that you can go to easily by clicking a bookmark icon in the Personal Toolbar
  or choosing the bookmark's name from the Bookmarks menu.</p>
<p><b id="CA">CA.</b>&nbsp; See <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a></p>
<p><b id="CA_certificate">CA certificate.</b>&nbsp; A certificate that
  identifies a certificate authority. See also <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a>, <a href="#subordinate_CA">subordinate CA</a>,
<a href="#root_CA">root
  CA</a>.</p>
<p><b id="cache">cache.</b>&nbsp;A collection of web page copies stored
  on your computer's hard disk or in its random-access memory (RAM). The browser
  accumulates these copies as you browse the Web. When you click a link or type
  a <a href="#Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a> to fetch a particular web
  page for which the cache already contains a copy, the browser compares the cached
  copy to the original. If there have been no changes, the browser uses the cached
  copy rather than refetching the original, saving processing and download time.
</p>
<p><b id="certificate">certificate.</b>The digital
  equivalent of an ID card. A certificate specifies the name of an individual,
  company, or other entity and certifies that a public key, which is included
  in the certificate, belongs to that entity. When you digitally sign a message
  or other data, the digital signature for that message is created with the aid
  of the private key that corresponds to the public key in your certificate. A
  certificate is issued and digitally signed by a
<a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a>. A certificate's validity can be verified by checking the
  CA's <a href="#digital_signature">digital signature</a>. Also called digital
  ID, digital passport, public-key certificate, X.509 certificate, and security
  certificate. See also <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</p>
<p><b id="certificate_authority">certificate authority (CA).</b>&nbsp;A service that issues a certificate
  after verifying the identity of the person or entity the certificate is intended
  to identify. A CA also renews and revokes certificates and generates a list
  of revoked certificates at regular intervals. CAs can be independent vendors or a person or organization using certificate-issuing server
  software (such as Mozilla Certificate Management System). See also
<a href="#certificate">certificate</a>, <a href="#certificate_revocation_list">certificate revocation list (CRL)</a>.</p>
<p><b id="certificate_backup_password">certificate backup password.</b>&nbsp;A password that protects a certificate
  that you are backing up or have previously backed up. Certificate Manager asks
  you to set this password when you back up a certificate, and requests it when
  you attempt to restore a certificate that has previously been backed up. </p>
<p><b id="certificate-based_authentication">certificate-based authentication.</b>&nbsp; Verification of identity
  based on certificates and public-key cryptography. See also
<a href="#password-based_authentication">password-based
  authentication</a>.</p>
<p><b id="certificate_chain">certificate chain.</b>&nbsp; A hierarchical series of certificates signed
  by successive certificate authorities. A CA certificate identifies a
<a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a> and is used to sign certificates issued by that authority.
  A CA certificate can in turn be signed by the CA certificate of a parent CA
  and so on up to a <a href="#root_CA">root CA</a>. </p>
<p><b id="certificate_fingerprint">certificate fingerprint.</b>&nbsp;
  A unique number associated with a certificate. The number is not part of
  the certificate itself but is produced by applying a mathematical function to
  the contents of the certificate. If the contents of the certificate change,
  even by a single character, the function produces a different number. Certificate
  fingerprints can therefore be used to verify that certificates have not been
  tampered with.</p>
<p><b id="Certificate_Manager">Certificate
  Manager</b>&nbsp; The part of the browser that allows you to view and manage
  certificates. To view the main Certificate Manager window: Open the Edit menu (Mozilla menu on Mac OS X),
  choose Preferences, click Privacy and Security, and then click Manage Certificates.</p>
<p><b id="certificate_renewal">certificate renewal.</b>&nbsp; The process of renewing a
<a href="#certificate">certificate</a>
  that is about to expire.</p>
<p><b id="certificate_revocation_list">certificate revocation list (CRL).</b>&nbsp; A list of revoked certificates
  that is generated and signed by a <a href="#certificate_authority">certificate
  authority (CA)</a>. You can download the latest CRL to your browser or to a
  server, then check against it to make sure that certificates are still valid
  before permitting their use for authentication. </p>
<p><b id="certificate_verification">certificate verification.</b>&nbsp; When
<a href="#Certificate_Manager">Certificate
  Manager</a> verifies a certificate, it confirms that the digital signature was
  created by a CA whose own CA certificate is both on file with Certificate Manager
  and marked as trusted for issuing that kind of certificate. It also confirms
  that the certificate being verified has not itself been marked as untrusted.
  Finally, if the <a href="#Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">Online Certificate Status Protocol
  (OCSP)</a> has been activated, Certificate Manager also performs an online check.
  It does so by looking up the certificate in a list of valid certificates maintained
  at a URL that is specified either in the certificate itself or in the browser's
  Validation preferences. If any of these checks fail, Certificate Manager marks
  the certificate as unverified and won't recognize the identity it certifies.</p>
<p><b id="cipher">cipher.</b>&nbsp;
  See <a href="#cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</a>.</p>
<p><b id="client">client.</b>&nbsp;
  Software (such as browser software) that sends requests to and receives information
  from a <a href="#server">server</a>, which is usually running
  on a different computer. A computer on which client software runs is also described
  as a client.</p>
<p><b id="client_authentication">client authentication.</b>&nbsp; The process of identifying a
<a href="#client">client</a>
  to a <a href="#server">server</a>, for example with a name and
  password or with a <a href="#client_SSL_certificate">client SSL certificate</a>
  and some digitally signed data. See also <a href="#Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure
  Sockets Layer (SSL)</a>, <a href="#server_authentication">server authentication</a>.</p>
<p><b id="client_SSL_certificate">client SSL certificate.</b>&nbsp;  A certificate that a
<a href="#client">client</a>
  (such as browser software) presents to a <a href="#server">server</a>
  to authenticate the identity of the client (or the identity of the person using
  the client) using the <a href="#Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</a>
  protocol. See also <a href="#client_authentication">client authentication</a>.</p>
<p><b id="Component_Bar">Component Bar.</b>&nbsp;The toolbar located
  at the bottom left of any Mozilla window. The Component Bar allows you to switch
  between Mozilla components by clicking icons for Navigator, Mail &amp; Newsgroups,
  Instant Messenger, and so on. </p>
<p><b id="cookie">cookie.</b>&nbsp;A small bit of information stored
  on your computer by some web sites. When you visit such a site, the site asks
  your browser to place one or more cookies on your hard disk. Later, when you
  return to the site, your browser sends the site the cookies that belong to it.
  Cookies help web sites keep track of information about you, such as the contents
  of your shopping cart. You can set your cookie preferences to control how cookies
  are used and how much information you are willing to let web sites store on
  them. See also <a href="#foreign_cookie">foreign cookie</a>.</p>
<p><b id="Cookie_Manager">Cookie Manager.</b>&nbsp;The part of the browser
  that you can use to control <a href="#cookie">cookies</a>.</p>
<p><b id="cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm.</b>&nbsp; A set of rules or directions used
  to perform cryptographic operations such as <a href="#encryption">encryption</a>
  and <a href="#decryption">decryption</a>. Sometimes called a <i>cipher.</i></p>
<p><b id="cryptography">cryptography.</b>&nbsp;
  The art and practice of scrambling (encrypting) and unscrambling (decrypting)
  information. For example, cryptographic techniques are used to scramble an unscramble
  information flowing between commercial web sites and your browser. See also
<a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</p>
<p><b id="decryption">decryption.</b>&nbsp;
  The process of unscrambling data that has been encrypted. See also
<a href="#encryption">encryption</a>.</p>
<p><b id="digital_ID">digital ID.</b>&nbsp;
   See <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.</p>
<p> <b id="digital_signature">
  digital signature.</b>&nbsp; A code created from both the data to be
  signed and the private key of the signer. This code is unique for each new piece
  of data. Even a single comma added to a message changes the digital signature
  for that message. Successful validation of your digital signature by appropriate
  software not only provides evidence that you approved the transaction or message,
  but also provides evidence that the data has not changed since you digitally
  signed it. A digital signature has nothing to do with a handwritten signature,
  although it can sometimes be used for similar legal purposes. See also
<a href="#nonrepudiation">nonrepudiation</a>, <a href="#tamper_detection">tamper detection</a>.</p>
<p><b id="distinguished_name">distinguished name (DN).</b>&nbsp; A specially formatted name that uniquely
  identifies the subject of a certificate.</p>
<p><b id="dual_key_pairs">dual
  key pairs.</b>&nbsp; Two public-private key pairs--four keys altogether--corresponding
  to two separate certificates. The private key of one pair is used for signing
  operations, and the public and private keys of the other pair are used for encryption
  and decryption operations. Each pair corresponds to a separate
<a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.
  See also <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</p>
<p><b id="eavesdropping">eavesdropping.</b>&nbsp;
  Surreptitious interception of information sent over a network by an entity
  for which the information is not intended.</p>
<p><b id="encryption">encryption.</b>&nbsp;
  The process of scrambling information in a way that disguises its meaning.
  For example, encrypted connections between computers make it very difficult
  for third-parties to unscramble, or <i>decrypt,</i> information flowing over
  the connection. Encrypted information can be decrypted only by someone who possesses
  the appropriate key. See also <a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</p>
<p><b id="encryption_certificate">encryption certificate.</b>&nbsp;
  A <a href="#certificate">certificate</a> whose public key is used for encryption only.
  Encryption certificates are not used
  for signing operations. See also <a href="#dual_key_pairs">dual key pairs</a>,
<a href="#signing_certificate">signing certificate</a>.</p>
<p><b id="encryption_key">encryption
  key.</b>&nbsp;  A private key used for encryption only. An encryption key
  and its equivalent private key, plus a <a href="#signing_key">signing
  key</a> and its equivalent public key, constitute a <a href="#dual_key_pairs">dual
  key pairs</a>.</p>
<p><b id="XSLT">Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT).</b>&nbsp;
  A language used to convert an XML document into another XML document or into
  some other format.</p>
<p><b id="XML">Extensible Markup Language (XML).</b>&nbsp; An open standard
  for describing data. Unlike HTML, XML allows the developer of a web page to
  define special tags. For more information, see the online W3C document <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" target="_blank">Extensible
  Markup Language (XML)</a>.</p>
<p><b id="File_Transfer_Protocol">File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</b>&nbsp;A
  standard that allows users to transfer files from one computer to another over
  a network. You can use your browser to fetch files using FTP.</p>
<p><b id="fingerprint">fingerprint.</b>&nbsp;
  See <a href="#certificate_fingerprint">certificate fingerprint</a>.</p>
<p><b id="FIPS_PUBS_140-1">FIPS
  PUBS 140-1.</b>&nbsp; Federal Information Processing Standards Publications
  (FIPS PUBS) 140-1 is a US government standard for implementations of cryptographic
  modules--that is, hardware or software that encrypts and decrypts data or performs
  other cryptographic operations (such as creating or verifying digital signatures).
  Many products sold to the US government must comply with one or more of the
  FIPS standards.</p>
<p><b id="foreign_cookie">foreign cookie.</b>&nbsp;A cookie from one
  site that gets stored on your computer when you visit a different site. Sometimes
  a web site displays content that is hosted on another web site. That content
  can be anything from an image to text or an advertisement. The second web site
  that hosts such elements also has the ability to store a cookie in your browser,
  even though you don't visit it directly. Also known as &quot;third-party cookie.&quot;
</p>
<p><b id="Form_Manager">Form Manager.</b>&nbsp;The part of the browser
  that can help you save the personal data you enter into online forms, such as
  your name, address, phone, and so on. Then, when a web site presents you with
  a form, Form Manager can fill it in automatically.</p>
<p><b id="helper_application">helper application.</b>&nbsp;Any application
  that is used to open or view a file downloaded by the browser. A <a href="#plug-in">plug-in</a>
  is a special kind of helper application that installs itself into the Plugins
  directory of the main browser installation directory and can typically be opened
  within the browser itself (internally). Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, and
  other external applications are considered helper applications but not plug-ins,
  since they don't install themselves into the browser directory, but can be opened
  from the download dialog box. </p>
<p><b id="home_page">home page.</b>&nbsp;The page your browser is set
  to display every time you launch it or when you click the Home button. Also
  used to refer to the main page for a web site, from which you can explore the
  rest of the site.</p>
<p><b id="Hypertext_Markup_Language">Hypertext Markup Language
  (HTML).</b>&nbsp; The document format used for Web pages. The HTML standard
  defines tags, or codes, used to define the text layout, fonts, style, images,
  and other elements that make up a web page. </p>
<p><b id="implicit_consent">implicit consent.</b>&nbsp; Also known as
  implied or &quot;opt-out&quot; consent. Used to describe privacy settings that
  may allow web sites to gather information about you (for example by means of
  <a href="#cookie">cookies</a> and online forms) unless you explicitly choose
  to withhold your consent by selecting an option on a page that the web site
  provides for that purpose. Your consent may not be requested when the information
  is actually gathered.</p>
<p><b id="IMAP_glossary">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).</b>&nbsp;A
  standard mail server protocol that allows you to store all your messages and
  any changes to them on the server rather than on your computer's hard disk.
  Using IMAP rather than <a href="#POP_glossary">POP</a> saves disk space and
  allows you to access your entire mailbox, including sent mail, drafts, and custom
  folders, from any location. Using an IMAP server over a modem is generally faster
  than using a POP mail server, since you initially download message headers only.
  Not all ISPs support IMAP. </p>
<p><b id="Internet">Internet.</b>&nbsp;A worldwide network of millions
  of computers that communicate with each other using standard protocols such
  as <a href="#Transmission_Control_Protocol_Internet_Protocol">TCP/IP</a>.
  Originally developed for the US military in 1969, the Internet grew to include
  educational and research institutions and, in the late 1990s, millions of businesses,
  organizations, and individuals. Today the Internet is used for email, browsing
  the <a href="#World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>, instant messaging, usegroups,
  and many other purposes.</p>
<p><b id="Internet_protocol_address">Internet protocol
  address (IP address).</b>&nbsp;The address of a computer on a <a href="#Transmission_Control_Protocol_Internet_Protocol">TCP/IP</a>
  network. Every computer on the Internet has an IP address. <a href="#client">Clients</a>
  have either a permanent IP address or one that is dynamically assigned to them
  each time they connect with the network. IP addresses are written as four sets
  of numbers, like this: 204.171.64.2. </p>
<p><b id="Java">Java.</b>&nbsp;A programming language developed by Sun
  Microsystems. A single Java program can run on many different kinds of computers,
  thus avoiding the need for programmers to create a separate version of each
  program for each kind of computer. Your browser can automatically download and
  run Java programs (also called applets).</p>
<p><b id="JavaScript">JavaScript.</b>&nbsp;A scripting language commonly
  used to construct web pages. Programmers use JavaScript to make web pages more
  interactive; for example, to display forms and buttons. JavaScript can be used
  with Java, but is technically a separate language. Java is not required for
  JavaScript to work correctly.</p>
<p><b id="key">key.</b>&nbsp;A large
  number used by a <a href="#cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</a>
  to encrypt or decrypt data. A person's public key, for example, allows other
  people to encrypt messages to that person. The encrypted messages must be decrypted
  with the corresponding private key. See also
<a href="#public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.</p>
<p><b id="LDAP_glossary">Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol (LDAP).</b>&nbsp; A standard protocol for accessing directory services,
  such as corporate address books, across multiple platforms. You can set up your
  browser to access LDAP directories from the Address Book. You can also set up
  Mail &amp; Newsgroups to use an LDAP directory for email address autocompletion.
</p>
<p><b id="location_bar">Location Bar.</b>&nbsp; The field (and associated
  buttons) near the top of a Navigator window where you can type a <a href="#Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a>
or search terms.</p>
<p><b id="master_key">master key.</b>&nbsp;
  A symmetric key used by Certificate Manager to encrypt information. For
  example, Password Manager uses Certificate Manager and your master key to encrypt
  email passwords, web site passwords, and other stored sensitive information.
  See also <a href="#symmetric_encryption">symmetric encryption</a>.</p>
<p><b id="master_password">master
  password.</b>&nbsp;A password used by Certificate Manager to protect the
  master key and/or private keys stored on a <a href="#security_device">security
  device</a>. Certificate Manager needs to access your private keys, for example,
  when you sign email messages or use one of your own certificates to identify
  yourself to a web site. It needs to access your master key when Password Manager
  or Form Manager reads or adds to your personal information. You can set or change
  your master password from the Master Passwords preferences panel. Each security
  device requires a separate master password. See also <a href="#private_key">private
  key</a>, <a href="#master_key">master key</a>.</p>
<p><b id="misrepresentation">misrepresentation.</b>&nbsp; Presentation of an entity as a person or
  organization that it is not. For example, a web site might pretend to be a furniture
  store when it is really just a site that takes credit card payments but never
  sends any goods. See also <a href="#spoofing">spoofing</a>.</p>
<p><b id="navigation_toolbar">Navigation Toolbar.</b>&nbsp; The toolbar
  near the top of the browser window that includes the Back and Forward buttons.</p>
<p><b id="nonrepudiation">nonrepudiation.</b>&nbsp;
  The inability, of the sender of a message, to deny having sent the message.
  A regular hand-written signature provides one form of nonrepudiation. A
<a href="#digital_signature">digital
  signature</a> provides another.</p>
<p><b id="object_signing">object signing.</b>&nbsp; A technology that allows software developers to sign
  Java code, JavaScript scripts, or any kind of file, and that allows users to
  identify the signers and control access by signed code to local system resources.</p>
<p><b id="object-signing_certificate">
  object-signing certificate.</b>&nbsp; A certificate whose corresponding
  private key is used to sign objects such as code files. See also
<a href="#object_signing">object
  signing</a>.</p>
<p><b id="Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">
  Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).</b>&nbsp; A set of rules
  that Certificate Manager follows to perform an online check of a certificate's
  validity each time the certificate is used. This process involves checking the
  certificate against a list of valid certificates maintained at a specified web
  site. Your computer must be online for OCSP to work.</p>
<p><b id="p3p">
  P3P</b>&nbsp; See <a href="#platform_for_privacy_preferences">Platform for Privacy
  Preferences (P3P)</a>.</p>
<p><b id="password-based_authentication">
  password-based authentication.</b>&nbsp; Confident identification by
  means of a name and password. See also <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>.</p>
<p><b id="Password_Manager">Password Manager.</b>&nbsp;The part of the
  browser that can help you remember some or all of your names and passwords by
  storing them on your computer's hard disk, and entering them for you
  automatically when you visit such sites.</p>
<p><b id="personal_toolbar">Personal Toolbar.</b>&nbsp; The customizable
  toolbar that appears just below the location bar by default in Navigator . It
  contains standard buttons such as Home, Search, Bookmarks, and so on that you
  can add or remove. You can also add buttons for your favorite bookmarks, or
  folders containing groups of bookmarks.</p>
<p><b id="PKCS_11">PKCS #11.</b>&nbsp;
  The public-key cryptography standard that governs security devices such
  as smart cards. See also <a href="#security_device">security device</a>,
<a href="#smart_card">smart card</a>.</p>
<p><b id="PKCS_11_module">PKCS
  #11 module.</b>&nbsp; A program on your computer that manages cryptographic
  services such as encryption and decryption using the PKCS #11 standard. Also
  called <i>cryptographic modules</i>, <i>cryptographic service providers,</i>
  or <i>security modules</i>, PKCS #11 modules control either hardware or software
  devices. A PKCS #11 module always controls one or more slots, which may be implemented
  as some form of physical reader (for example, for reading smart cards) or in
  software. Each slot for a PKCS #11 module can in turn contain a
<a href="#security_device">security
  device</a> (also called <i>token</i>), which is the hardware or software
  device that provides cryptographic services and stores certificates and keys.
  Certificate Manager provides two built-in PKCS #11 modules. You may install
  additional modules on your computer to control smart card readers or other hardware
  devices.</p>
<p><b id="platform_for_privacy_preferences">Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P).</b>&nbsp;A standard
  published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) designed to help users to gain
  more control over the use of personal information by Web sites they visit. For
  general information on the standard itself, see the online document <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/" target="_blank">P3P
  Public Overview</a>.</p>
<p><b id="plug-in">plug-in.</b>&nbsp;A type of <a href="#helper_application">helper
  application</a> that adds new capabilities to your browser, such as the ability
  to play audio or video clips. Unlike other kinds of helper applications, a plug-in
  application installs itself into the Plugins directory within the main browser
  installation directory and typically can be opened within the browser itself
  (internally). For example, an audio plug-in lets you listen to audio files on
  a web page or in an e-mail message. Macromedia Flash Player and Java are both
  examples of plug-in applications.</p>
<p><b id="POP_glossary">Post Office Protocol (POP).</b>&nbsp;A standard
  mail server protocol that requires you to download new messages to your local
  computer&mdash;although you can choose to leave copies on the server. With POP,
  you can store all your messages, including sent mail, drafts, and custom folders,
  on one computer only. By contrast, <a href="#IMAP_glossary">IMAP</a> allows
  you to permanently store all your messages and any changes to them on the server,
  where you can access them from any computer. Most ISPs currently support POP.
</p>
<p><b id="private_key">private key.</b>&nbsp;
  One of a pair of <a href="#key">keys</a> used in public-key cryptography.
  The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted
  with the corresponding public key.</p>
<p><b id="proxy">proxy.</b>&nbsp;An intermediary or &quot;go-between&quot;
  program that acts as both a <a href="#server">server</a> and a <a href="#client">client</a>
  for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients.</p>
<p><b id="public_key">public key.</b>&nbsp;
  One of a pair of <a href="#key">keys</a> used in public-key cryptography.
  The public key is distributed freely and published as part of a

  decrypts the data with the corresponding private key.</p>
<p><b id="public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography.</b>&nbsp;A set of well-established techniques
  and standards that allow an entity (such as a person, an organization, or hardware
  such as a router) to verify its identity electronically or to sign and encrypt
  electronic data. Two keys are involved: a <a href="#public_key">public
  key</a> and a <a href="#private_key">private key</a>. The public key
  is published as part of a <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>, which
  associates that key with a particular identity. The corresponding private key
  is kept secret. Data encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with
  the private key. </p>
<p><b id="public-key_infrastructure">public-key infrastructure (PKI).</b>&nbsp;The standards and services
  that facilitate the use of public-key cryptography and certificates in a networked
  environment.</p>

<p><b id="search_engine">search engine.</b>&nbsp;A web-based program
  that allows users to search for and retrieve specific information from the World
  Wide Web. The search engine may search the full text of web documents or a list
  of keywords, or use librarians who review web documents and index them manually
  for retrieval. Typically, the user types a word or phrase, also called a query,
  into a search box, and the search engine displays links to relevant web pages.</p>
<p><b id="Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</b>&nbsp;A protocol that allows mutual
  authentication between a <a href="#client">client</a> and a <a href="#server">server</a>
  for the purpose of establishing an authenticated and encrypted connection. SSL
  runs above TCP/IP and below HTTP, LDAP, IMAP, NNTP, and other high-level network
  protocols. The new Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard called Transport
  Layer Security (TLS) is based on SSL. See also <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>,
<a href="#encryption">encryption</a>.</p>
<p><b id="security_certificate">security certificate.</b>&nbsp; See <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.</p>
<p><b id="security_device">security
  device.</b>&nbsp; Hardware or software that provides cryptographic services
  such as encryption and decryption and can store certificates and keys. A smart
  card is one example of a security device implemented in hardware. <a href="#Certificate_Manager">Certificate
  Manager</a> contains its own built-in security device, called the <a href="#software_security_device">software
  security device</a>, that is always available while the browser is running.
