<a NAME="My_Certificates"></a><h2>Your Certificates</h2>

<p>The Your Certificates tab in the <A href="#certs_first">Certificate Manager</a> displays the certificates on file that identify you. Your certificates are listed under the names of the organizations that issued them:

<ul>
	<li>If you can't see certificate names under an organization's name, double-click the name. 
	<li>To select a certificate, click its name. 
	<li>To select more than one certificate, hold down the Control key and click their names. 
</ul>

<p>To perform the following actions, select one or more certificates and click one of the following buttons:
<UL>
  <LI><b>View:</b> Display detailed information about the selected certificates.</LI>
  <LI><b>Backup:</b> Initiate the process of saving the selected certificates. A window appears that allows you to choose a password to protect the backup. You can then save the backup in a directory of your choice.</LI>
  <LI><b>Delete:</b> Delete the selected certificates.</LI>
</UL>

<P>These actions do not require a certificate to be selected:</P>
<UL>

  <LI><b>Import:</b> Import a file containing one or more certificates that were previously backed up. When you click Import, Certificate Manager first asks you to locate the file that contains the backup. The names of certificate backup files typically end in <tt>.p12</tt>; for example, <tt>MyCert.p12</tt>. After you select the file to be imported, Certificate Manager asks you to enter the password that you set when you backed up the certificate.</LI>

  <LI><b>Backup All:</b> Initiate the process of saving all the certificates stored in the <a href="glossary.html#software_security_device">Software Security Device</a>. 

<p><b>Note: Certificates on smart cards cannot be backed up.</b> Whether you select some of your certificates and click Backup, or click Backup All, the resulting backup file will not include any certificates stored on smart cards or other external security devices. You can only back up certificates that are stored on the built-in Software Security Device.

</UL>
  

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr><a NAME="Choose_a_Certificate_Backup_Password"></a>
<H3>Choose a Certificate Backup Password</H3>

<P>A certificate backup password protects one or more certificates that you are backing up from the <a href="#My_Certificates">Your Certificates</a> tab in the Certificate Manager. 

<p>The Certificate Manager asks you to set this password when you back up certificates, and requests it when you attempt to import certificates that have previously been backed up.</P>

<ul>
<li><b>Certificate backup password:</b> Type your backup password into this field.

<li><b>Certificate backup password (again):</b> Type your backup password again. If you don't type it the second time exactly as you did the first time, the OK button remains inactive. If this happens, try typing the new password again. 
</ul>

<p>If someone obtains the file containing a certificate that you have backed up and successfully imports the certificate, that person can send messages or access web sites while pretending to be you. This can be a problem, for example, if you digitally sign important email messages or manage your bank or investment accounts over the Internet. 

<p>Therefore, it's important to select a certificate backup password that is difficult to guess. The <b>password quality meter</b> gives you a rough idea of the quality of your password as you type it based on factors such as length and the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It does not guarantee that your password cannot be guessed, however.

<p>For further guidelines, see the online document <a href="http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/passwords.html"  TARGET="_blank">Choosing a Good Password</a>. 

<p>It's also important to record the password in a safe place&mdash;and not anywhere that's easily accessible to someone else. If you forget this password, you can't import the backup of your certificate.</p>

<h3>Edit Web Site Certificate Trust Settings</h3>
 
<p>When you select a web site certificate from the <A href="#Web_Site_Certificates">Web Sites</a> tab in the Certificate Manager and click Edit, you see a window entitled &quot;Edit web site certificate trust settings.&quot; 

Here you specify whether you want to trust the selected certificate for identifying the web site and setting up an encrypted connection.<p>

<p>The dialog box contains these elements:

<ul>

        <li><b>The certificate &quot;<i>name of certificate</i>&quot; was issued by:</b> Provides information about the <a href="glossary.html#certificate_authority">certificate authority</a> that issued this certificate.

	<li><b>Edit certificate trust settings:</b></li>

<ul>
	<li><b>Trust the authenticity of this certificate:</b> If you select this option, Certificate Manager will henceforth trust this certificate for the purposes of identifying this web site or setting up an encrypted connection. If you select this option and then attempt to visit the web site, your browser will access the site with few, if any, warnings.

	<li><b>Do not trust the authenticity of this certificate:</b> If you select this option, Certificate Manager will no longer trust this certificate for the purposes of identifying this web site or setting up an encrypted connection. If you select this option and then attempt to visit the web site, you will see one or more warning messages before you can access the site.

</ul>
<li><b>Edit CA Trust:</b> Click this button to specify trust settings for the certificate authority (CA) that issued the web site certificate. These settings allow you to trust or not to trust different kinds of certificates issued by that certificate authority. For example, you can choose to trust all web site certificates issued by the authority.
</ul>

<p>Click OK to confirm your choice.

<h2>Authorities</h2>

<p>The Authorities tab in the <A href="#certs_first">Certificate Manager</a> displays the certificates you have on file that identify <a href="glossary.html#certificate_authority_(CA)">certificate authorities (CAs)</a>.


<p>CA certificates are grouped under the names of the organizations that issued them:

<ul>
	<li>If you can't see CA certificate names under an organization's name, double-click the name. 
	<li>To select a CA certificate, click its name. 
	<li>To select more than one CA certificate, hold down the Control key and click their names. 
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><b>View:</b> Display detailed information about the selected certificates.

	<li><b>Delete:</b> Delete the selected certificates.
</ul>

<p>To ensure that an entire <a href="glossary.html#certificate_chain">certificate chain</a> of CAs are all trusted, you need to edit the root CA certifiate only. 

<p>To import the chain, you click a link on a web page provided by the CA. You can then use the authorities tab to locate the root certificate and edit its  trust settings. 

<p>The root and intermediate CAs all appear under the same organization. The root certificate is the one that lists itself as the the issuer.

<p><b>If you download an intermediate CA:</b> If you download an intermediate CA certificate that chains to a root certificate already marked as trusted in your browser, you don't have to indicate what purposes you trust it for. Intermediate certificates automatically inherit the trust settings of their roots.

<h1>Device Manager</h1>

<p>This section describes the options available in the Device Manager window. For background information and step-by-step instructions on the use of the Device Manager, see <a href="using_certs_help.html#using_certs_devices">Manage Smart Cards and Other Security Devices</a>. 

<P>If you are not currently viewing the Device Manager window, follow these steps:

<ol>
