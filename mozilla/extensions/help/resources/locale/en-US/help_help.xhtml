<h2>Finding the Topic You Want</h2>

<p>When you're viewing the Help window, click the tabs in the left frame to view the Help contents in different ways:

<ul>
	<li><b>Contents</b> shows the list of main topics.
	<p>Click a topic to read about it. Double-click to see its subtopics. 

	<p>If you can't find the topic you want, click the Search or Index tab.
	<li><b>Search</b> lets you search the built-in Mozilla Help.
	<p>Type a word or phrase and press Enter to see related topics. Then click the topic you want to read about.

	<p>If your Search doesn't return any topics, try typing fewer words or a different combination of words.
	
	<li><b>Index</b> lists topics alphabetically.
	<p>Click an index entry to view information on that topic.
	<li><b>Glossary</b> lists definitions alphabetically.
	<p>Click a glossary term to see its definition.
</ul>
	
<p>To see information related to the Help topic you're reading about, click links in the Help window just as you would in a regular web page. 

<p>For example, this link brings you to a glossary definition: <a href="glossary.html#cookie">cookie</a>. (Click the Back button to return to this page.)

<h2>Retracing Your Steps</h2>

<p>To retrace your steps in Help, click the buttons near the top-left corner of the Help window:

<p><table summary="Help and Support Center" width = "300">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="Help navigation icons" src="images/help_nav.gif">
</td><td><b>Help and Support Center</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward</b>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


<ul>
	<li>Click the Back button to move back through pages you have previously visited. It works just like the Back button in the browser. 	
	<li>Click the Forward button to move forward through pages you have previously visited. It works just like the Forward button in the browser. 	
	<li>Click the Home button to see the Help and Support Center, including links to support options and web-based resources.
</ul>

<p>If you're having trouble keeping the Help window visible while you're following instructions, click Mozilla Help in the Windows toolbar to bring it to the front again.

<p>Alternatively, print the instructions you want to follow:</li>
	<ul><li>To print the whole page that's currently displayed in the Help window, click the Print button near the top-right corner of the Help window:

<p><img alt="Help print icon" src="images/help_print.gif">

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Print</b>

<li>To print just a portion of the page, first click and drag to select the area you want to print, then click the Print button.</ul>

<h2>Using Help Shortcuts</h2>

<p>You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate within the Help window. For details, see <a href="shortcuts.xhtml#help_window_shortcuts">Help Window Shortcuts</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<a NAME="buttons"></a>
<h2>Using Help Buttons</h2>

<p>Many specialized Mozilla windows and dialog boxes include a button labeled "Help".

<p>Click any Help button to see detailed information about the window in which it appears.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a NAME="search_tips"></a>
<h2>Search Tips</h2>
<p>Not finding what you want in the Search?  Here are a few tips that could help:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be sure that you are searching for something that relates to Mozilla; This is not a web search.</li>
    <li>Try to broaden your search - don't be too specific; The terms could be worded differently than what you search for.</li>
    <li>Avoid being too broad with your search: words like &quot;Mail&quot; and &quot;mozilla&quot; could possibly return all of the pages in the help file.</li>
</ul>
