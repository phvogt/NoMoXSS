<h1>Python XPCOM Package Architecture</h1>
<h2><a name="Architecture">Architecture</a></h2>
<p>Much of the design for the Python XPCOM Package has been borrowed from the Python MS-COM
extensions in <i>win32com</i>. Most of the major limitations and drawbacks in the <i>win32com</i>
design have been addressed, mainly &quot;auto-wrapping&quot; of
interface objects, which is not supported by <i>win32com</i>.</p>
<p>Like <i>win32com</i>, this architecture includes the concept of <i>client COM</i> and <i>server
COM.</i> </p>
<p>Client COM:</p>
<ul>
  <li>calls other interfaces</li>
  <li>is supported by <i>PyInterfaces</i> implemented in C++, which assists
in making the COM calls</li>
  <li>is supported by <i>PyGateways</i>, which assists in receiving
external COM calls and dispatching them to the correct Python object</li>
  <li> is supported in the <i>xpcom/client</i>  package</li>
</ul>
<p>Server COM:</p>
<ul>
  <li>implements interfaces for use by other XPCOM applications or components</li>
  <li> is
supported in the <i>xpcom/server</i>  package</li>
</ul>
<p>The XPConnect framework is very powerful, and far exceeds what COM's <i>
IDispatch</i> can offer.&nbsp; Thus, we are able to get by with far fewer interfaces
supported in the C++ level, and defer most things to the Python code that uses
XPConnect.&nbsp; As a result, the requirement for a huge number of interfaces to
exist in the <i>.pyd</i> does not exist.&nbsp; There are, however, a number of
interfaces that do require native C++ support: these are interfaces
required to &quot;boot&quot; the XPConnect support (i.e., the interfaces that are
used to get information about interfaces), and also two gateways that need to
work without interface information available. This last requirement is
due to the XPCOM shutdown-ordering - it may be a bug, but is not an unreasonable
amount of code anyway.</p>
<p><b>Auto-wrapping</b> of COM objects is supported by both client COM and
server COM.&nbsp;For client COM, auto-wrapping means that the
Python programmer always sees Python &quot;component&quot; objects, rather than
raw C++ interface objects; to the user, it all appears to &quot;just
work&quot;.&nbsp; This is a major source of frustration in the <i>win32com</i>
framework.</p>
<p>For server COM, auto-wrapping means that you can
pass Python instances wherever a COM object is expected. If the Python
instance supports COM interfaces, by virtue of having a <i>_com_interfaces_</i>
attribute that lists the interface requested, it will be automatically wrapped
in the correct COM object.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Error Handling:</b> The C++ framework has good error handling support,
and uses the XPCOM console service to log debug messages, Python exceptions and
tracebacks.&nbsp; <i>win32com</i> does not have good exception/traceback support
at the C++ level, mainly because COM does not define a service like
the console where debug messages can go.&nbsp; This does mean that in Mozilla
release builds, these debug messages are likely to be lost, but the <i>--console</i>
command line option to a release Mozilla will get them back.&nbsp; Therefore,
the other error-support utilities, such as the error callbacks made on the
policy object, may be used.</p>
<p><b>Component Loader, Modules and Factories:</b>&nbsp; XPCOM has the concept
of a component loader - a module used to load all components of a
particular type.&nbsp; For example, the <i>moz.jsloader.1</i> component loads all
the JavaScript components.&nbsp;Similarly, the <i>moz.pyloader.1</i>
component loads all Python components.&nbsp; However, unlike
JavaScript, the Python component loader is actually implemented in Python
itself!&nbsp;Since the Python component loader can not be used to load
itself, this component has some special code, <i>pyloader.dll,</i>  to boot-strap itself.</p>
<p>This means is that all XPCOM components, including the Python loader itself and all
XPCOM module and factory interfaces, are implemented in
Python.&nbsp;<b>There are no components or interfaces implemented purely in C++
in this entire package!</b></p>
