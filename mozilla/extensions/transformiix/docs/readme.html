<B>Transfor<FONT Color="blue">Mii</FONT>X</B> is an XSLT processor which is
not yet complete, but supports a good portion of the 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116">XSLT 1.0 recommendation</A>.

<P>
<B>Transfor<FONT Color="blue">Mii</FONT>X</B> was designed to be a "standalone" 
XSLT processor. This means you can call the processor from the command line,
or via the XSLProcessor API. The only thing TransforMiiX requires is an XML parser,
and the currently supported parser is 
<A href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html">Expat</A> written by James Clark.
</P>
<P>
There is currently an effort undergoing to integrate 
TransforMiiX with Mozilla. This effort
is not yet complete and therefor the XSLT processor cannot yet be used 
within the Mozilla browser. Integration is nearing completion, however.

<B>Running <B>Transfor<FONT Color="blue">Mii</FONT>X</B> from the command line</B>
<P />
The command line syntax is pretty straight forward:
<P>
<B>example:</B> <I>transfrmx -i my.xml -s my.xsl -o my.out</I>
</P>
This will process the XML source file called "my.xml" using the "my.xsl" XSLT stylesheet,
and the result will be placed in "my.out".

The "-s" flag is not required if the XSLT stylesheet is specified inside the XML source 
document using the "xml-stylesheet" PI (processing instruction).
<P>
The stylesheet PI, should appear below the XML declaration 
("<FONT SIZE="-1">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</FONT>").
<P>
<B>example:</B>
<TABLE BGColor="" BORDER="1">
<TR>
  <TD>
    <PRE>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="my.xsl" type="text/xsl"?&gt;
&lt;document&gt;
   ...
&lt;/document&gt;
    </PRE>
  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
The command line program is in "source/main/transformiix.cpp" and is simply
a wrapper for "source/xsl/XSLProcessor.cpp" which is the TransforMiiX API.
</P>
<P>
Feel free to run the examples in the "source/examples" directory, they are a
good example of what has been implemented so far in TransforMiiX.

<B>What is the current status of Transfor<FONT Color="blue">Mii</FONT>X</B>?
<P />
You can check the current status by looking three main files:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="changes.txt">changes.txt</A> - lists the changes from different builds
<LI><A HREF="remaining.txt">remaining.txt</A> - lists what needs to be implemented.
<LI><A HREF="known-issues.html">known-issues.html</A> - lists known bugs or issues.

<B>What can I do to help finish the implementation of
 Transfor<FONT Color="blue">Mii</FONT>X</B>?
<P />
There are a number of things that can be done:
<P>
<B>Development</B>
<OL>
<LI>Check out the source code, build it.
