/*
 * The nsILanguageAtom interface encapsulates a language code (as used in
 * HTML LANG attributes, for example). This interface also provides access
 * to the corresponding "language group" atom, to be used in the font
 * engine with preferences, for example.
 *
 * The nsILanguageAtom interface is similar to nsIAtom, in the sense that
 * one can compare 2 pointers for equality. The nsILanguageAtomService
 * creates nsILanguageAtoms by first lower-casing the language (since it's
 * case-insensitive according to RFC 1766), and then looking up that
 * language in a set of existing nsILanguageAtom objects. If it already
 * exists, that object is returned. If not, a new one is created and added
 * to the set for future retrieval.
