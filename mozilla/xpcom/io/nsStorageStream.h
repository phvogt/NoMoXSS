 * The storage stream provides an internal buffer that can be filled by a
 * client using a single output stream.  One or more independent input streams
 * can be created to read the data out non-destructively.  The implementation
 * uses a segmented buffer internally to avoid realloc'ing of large buffers,
 * with the attendant performance loss and heap fragmentation.
