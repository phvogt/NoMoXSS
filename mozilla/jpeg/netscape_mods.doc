This directory contains a subset of the IJG JPEG library.  Among other
omissions, most of the original IJG documentation has been deleted.
You can find the full IJG distribution at the archive sites mentioned in
the README file.  Please note that the IJG code does not fall under the
Netscape NPL, but is freely distributable under its own copyright terms
(see README).

Several files have been modified to allow incorporation of the IJG code
into the Netscape environment.  As of this writing, jconfig.h, jmorecfg.h,
and jerror.c contain Netscape-specific changes.  In addition, we have created
our own makefiles following Netscape conventions, rather than using any of
those provided by IJG.

There are some other changes herein, such as MMX-specific optimizations,
which should eventually make their way back into the standard IJG
distribution.
