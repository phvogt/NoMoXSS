  <h3 id="home_page">Home Page</h3>
  <p>Here you are able to specify the page (or tab group) that
    &brandShortName; will show when you launch it or press the Home button.
    Enter the address in the Location(s) field.</p>

  <p>Click <em>Use Current Page(s)</em> to use the page you're currently
    visiting. You can also use <strong>multiple home pages</strong>. If more
    than one browser tab is currently opened, this button will set the
    <strong>whole tab group</strong> as a start page.</p>

  <p>To specify the home page(s) using a bookmark, click <em>Use
    Bookmark....</em> You can even select a whole bookmark folder to be
    used!</p>

  <p>If you don't want a home page to be loaded, click <em>Use Blank
    Page</em>.</p>

  <h3 id="fonts_and_colors">Fonts &amp; Colors</h3>
  <p><img width="305" height="296" alt="Fonts and Colors Dialog"
    src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_fontsandcolors.png"/></p>
  <p>Click the <em>Fonts &amp; Colors...</em> button to change the default
    fonts and colors used by &brandShortName;.</p>

  <p><strong>Fonts for:</strong><br/>
    Normally, web pages are displayed in the default font set by your browser
    or in a font chosen by the web pages' authors.</p>
  <p>To change the default fonts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>From the <em>Fonts for</em> drop-down list, choose a character set.
        For instance, to set default fonts for the Western (Roman) character
        set, choose <em>Western</em>.</li>
      <li>Select whether proportional text should be serif (like &quot;Times
        New Roman&quot;) or sans-serif (like &quot;Arial&quot;). Then specify 
        the font size you want for proportional text.</li>
      <li>Specify the font to use for Serif, Sans-serif and Monospace fonts.
        You can also change the size for <code>Monospace fonts</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can also specify the display resolution, which is normally 96
      dpi.</p>

    <p>Finally, you can set the minimum font size to be used on screen. This
      can be useful on some sites that use very small fonts that are barely
      readable.</p>

    <p><strong>Text and Background</strong><br/>
    Here you can change the default text and background color to be used on
      web pages that haven't specified that information. Click on the color
      samples to select colors.</p>

    <p><em>Use system colors</em><br/>
      Check this option to use the colors defined in your OS settings instead
      of the colors specified above.</p>

    <p><strong>Link Colors</strong><br/>
    Here you can change the default colors for Web links. Click on the color
      samples to select colors.</p>

    <p><em>Underline links</em><br/>
      By default, links are underlined on web pages. Uncheck this option to
      disable this. Note that many sites specify their own styling rules
      and this option has no effect on those sites.</p>

    <p><strong>Always use my:</strong><br/>
    <em>Fonts</em><br/>
      By default &brandShortName; uses the fonts specified by the web page
      author. Enabling this option will force all sites to use your default
      fonts instead.</p>

    <p><em>Colors</em><br/>
      By default, &brandShortName; uses the colors specified by the web page
      author. Enabling this option will force all sites to use your default
      colors instead.</p>

    <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
    <p><img width="308" height="252" alt="Languages Options Dialog"
      src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_languages.png"/></p>
    <p>Some web pages are offered in more than one language. Click the
      <em>Languages</em> button to specify your preferred languages.</p>

    <p><strong>Language Selection</strong><br/>
      To add a language, press <em>Select a language to add...</em>, choose
      the language, and click the <em>Add</em> button. Remove a language by
      selecting it in the list of active languages and clicking the
      <em>Remove</em> button.</p>

    <p>You can reorder languages to determine the preferred one in case a page
      is provided in two or more of your selected languages. Do this using the
      <em>Move Up</em> and <em>Move Down</em> buttons.</p>

    <p><strong>Character Encoding</strong><br/>
      The character encoding selected here will be used to display pages that
      do not specify which encoding to use.</p>

    <h3 class="noMac" id="default_browser">Default Browser</h3>
    <p class="noMac">You can set &brandShortName; as the default
      browser by clicking <em>Set Default Browser</em>. This will ensure
      &brandShortName; is used whenever an application is trying to display a
      web page or when you open an HTML file.</p>

    <h3 id="connection_settings">Connection Settings</h3>

    <p><img width="275" height="296" alt="Connection Options Dialog"
      src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_connection.png"/></p>

    <p>Many organizations block access from the Internet to their networks.
      This prevents outside parties from gaining access to sensitive
      information. The protection is called a firewall.</p>
    <p>If your organization has a firewall, the browser may need to go through
      a proxy server before connecting you to the Internet. The proxy server
      prevents outsiders from breaking into your organization's private
      network.</p>

    <strong>Configure Proxies to Access the Internet</strong>

    <dl>
      <dt>Direct connection to the Internet</dt>
      <dd>This is the default option. Choose this if you don't want to use a
        proxy.</dd>

      <dt>Manual proxy configuration</dt>
      <dd>Choose this if you don't have a proxy location (URL). Ask your
        system administrator for the names and port numbers of the servers
        running proxy software for each network service and enter the
        information in the appropriate fields.</dd>

      <dt>Automatic proxy configuration URL</dt>
      <dd>If your workplace has a proxy configuration file, ask the system
        administrator for its URL and enter it here. Click <em>Reload</em> to
        load the settings.</dd>
    </dl>

<h2 id="privacy_options">Privacy Options</h2>

  <p><img width="425" height="353" alt="Privacy Options Dialog"
        src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_privacy.png"/></p>

  <p>The Privacy panel contains options related to your privacy. As you browse
    the web, information on where you have been, what pages you have visited,
    etc are stored here. You can click the <em>Clear</em> button on each
    section to clear that information. Alternatively you can clear all
    information stored while browsing by clicking <em>Clear All</em>. A
    confirmation dialog will be shown before clearing the information.</p>

  <p>To display section-specific options, expand a section by clicking on the
    small + button.</p>

  <h3 id="history">History</h3>
  <p>Here you can specify for how many days you want the browser to remember
    what pages you have visited. The default is 9 days.</p>

  <h3 id="saved_form_information">Saved Form Information</h3>
  <p><em>Save information I enter in web page forms and the Search
    bar</em><br/>When you enter information in web forms, &brandShortName;
    remembers what you type and automatically makes suggestions when you enter
    information again. To stop this behavior, uncheck this option.</p>

  <h3 id="saved_passwords">Saved Passwords</h3>
  <p><em>Remember Passwords</em><br/>&brandShortName; can securely
    save passwords you enter in web forms to make it easier to log on to
    web sites.  Clear this checkbox to prevent &brandShortName; from
    remembering your passwords.</p>

  <p><em>View Saved Passwords</em><br/>You can manage saved passwords and
    delete individual passwords by clicking the <em>View Saved Passwords</em>
    button.</p>

  <p id="set_change_master_password"><em>Set/Change Master Password...</em>
    <br/>&brandShortName; protects saved passwords and other private data by
    requiring the user to know a special master password.  You can set or
    change the master password by clicking this button.</p>

  <h3 id="download_manager_history">Download Manager History</h3>
  <p>The Download Manager (accessible from <span class="menuPath">Tools</span>
    or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>) stores shortcuts to your
    recent downloads. The Download options are available in the
    <strong>Downloads panel</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a file created by a web site that stores information on your
    computer, such as your preferences when visiting that site.</p>

  <p>To display the Cookie Manager click <em>View Cookies</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Allow sites to set cookies</em><br/>
    By default cookies are enabled. Uncheck this option to disable the use of
    cookies. Note that some sites may not work properly when cookies are
    disabled.</p>

  <p>Learn more about cookies, the individual preferences, and how you can gain
    control over what sites are allowed to store cookies on your computer by
    reading about <a href="cookies.xhtml">Managing Cookies</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="cache">Cache</h3>
  <p>Pages you view are normally stored in a special cache folder for quicker
    viewing the next time you visit the same page. Here you are able to
    specify the amount of disk space the cache can use.</p>

<h2 id="web_features_options">Web Features Options</h2>

  <p><img width="425" height="315" alt="Web Features Options Dialog"
    src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_webfeatures.png"/></p>

  <p><em>Block Popup Windows</em><br/>By default, &brandShortName; blocks
    annoying popup windows on web sites. Unchecking this option will disable
    popup blocking.</p>

  <p>Some sites make legitimate use of popup windows. Therefore, the popup
    blocking feature has a simple whitelist mechanism to allow certain sites
    to open popups anyway. To add a site to the whitelist, click
    <em>Allowed Sites</em>, then enter the site you want to allow popups from and
    click <em>Allow</em>.</p>

  <p>To remove a site from the whitelist, select that site from the list and
    then click <em>Remove Site</em>. To clear the whitelist completely, click
    <em>Remove All Sites</em>. Click <em>OK</em> to confirm your changes or
    click <em>Cancel</em> to discard them.</p>

  <p><em>Allow web sites to install software</em><br/>
    By default, web sites are allowed to install software such as extensions
    and plug-ins. You will be prompted to confirm each installation. Uncheck
    this option to completely disable software installation.</p>

  <p>Some sites have useful software to install into &brandShortName;. Like the 
    popup blocker, &brandShortName; has a simple whitelist mechanism to allow 
    certain sites to install software. Software installs are not possible 
    at all from sites which are not whitelisted, and you will still be prompted 
    for installation. To add a site to the whitelist, click 
    <em>Allowed Sites</em>, then enter the site you want to allow software
    installs from and click <em>Allow</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Load Images</em><br/>By default images are loaded on web pages.
    Uncheck this option to disable images completely.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>for the originating web site only</em><br/>Enabling this option
      will make sure that only images located at the current web site are
      loaded.</li>
  </ul>

    <p><img width="247" height="291" alt="Images Exceptions Dialog"
    src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_imagemanager.png"/></p>

    <p>Depending on if you enable images, you can change which sites are
      blocked or which sites can load images by clicking <em>Exceptions</em>.
      Enter the site you want to allow/deny images from and click
      <em>Allow</em> to allow images, or click <em>Block</em> to block the
      images. Click <em>OK</em> to confirm your changes, or click
      <em>Cancel</em> to discard them.</p>

  <p><em>Enable Java</em><br/>Java is a popular programming language for the
    web developed by Sun Microsystems. A single Java program can run on many
    different kinds of computers, thus avoiding the need for programmers to
    create a separate version of each program for each kind of computer.
    Uncheck this option to disable Java applets in &brandShortName;. Note that
    in order for Java applets to work, you must install the Java plugin.</p>

  <p><em>Enable JavaScript</em><br/>JavaScript is a scripting language
    commonly used to construct web pages. JavaScript is often used to
    dynamically validate forms and select buttons. Disabling JavaScript may
    cause some sites to not work properly.</p>

  <p>While it is usually recommended to keep JavaScript enabled, there are
    some functions that you may want to disable. Click the <em>Advanced...</em>
    button to display these options.</p>

  <p><img width="198" height="170" alt="JavaScript Options Dialog"
    src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_javascript.png"/></p>

  <h3 id="allow_scripts_to">Allow scripts to:</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Move or resize existing windows</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to disable moving and resizing windows using
      scripts.</dd>

    <dt>Raise or lower windows</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to make sure scripts cannot raise or lower
      windows.</dd>

    <dt>Disable or replace context menus</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to prevent web pages from disabling or changing
      the &brandShortName; context menu.</dd>

    <dt>Hide the status bar</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to force the status bar to be displayed in popup
      windows.</dd>

    <dt>Change status bar text</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to disable annoying status bar text scrolling and
      Web address hiding.</dd>

    <dt>Change images</dt>
    <dd>Uncheck this option to disable changing of images. Disabling this can
      make some menus harder to navigate.</dd>
  </dl>

<h2 id="downloads_options">Downloads Options</h2>

  <p><img
    src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_downloads.png"
    width="425" height="353" alt="Downloads Options Dialog"/></p>

  <p>This panel controls how &brandShortName; handles different file types
    such as applications, compressed files, and multimedia files.</p>

  <h3 id="download_folder">Download Folder</h3>

  <p><em>Ask me where to save every file</em><br/>This is the default option.
    &brandShortName; will ask you where you want the file to be saved whenever
    you download a file.</p>

  <p><em>Save all files to this folder:</em><br/>Alternatively, you can
    specify a default folder where all downloads will be saved, such as the
    &quot;My Downloads&quot; folder. You can browse to a specific folder by
    selecting <em>Other...</em> from the drop-down list of available folders.
    To show the folder, click the <em>Show Folder</em> button. This will open
    the folder in the default file manager.</p>

  <h3 id="file_types">File Types</h3>

  <p>This list contains file types that you have downloaded. You can choose
    what &brandShortName; should do when clicking on a specific file type.
    Select the file type you want to modify and click the <em>Change
    Action...</em> button.</p>

  <p>This will display the Change Action window, where you can choose to have
    the file type opened by an application or saved to disk. For example, if
    you view lots of media files on web pages, you might want to specify that
    &brandShortName; always open media files in your media player instead of
    asking where you want each media file to be saved.</p>

  <p><img width="293" height="236" alt="Change Action Dialog"
    src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_downloadaction.png"/></p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Open them in the Default application:</em><br/>Select this option
      to open this file type in the default application for that file type
      (determined by the operating system).</li>
    <li><em>Open them in this application:</em><br/>Select this option to
      specify another application that should handle this file type. You will
      see a dialog asking you to specify the application to use.</li>
    <li><em>Save to Disk</em><br/>This option will save the files to disk. If
      you have the <em>Save all files to this folder</em> option selected, the
      files will be saved automatically.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To remove an automatic rule for a file type, select that file type and
    click the <em>Remove</em> button.</p>
  <p>From the Downloads panel, you can also control the plug-ins for
    &brandShortName;. Click the <em>Plug-Ins...</em> button to display the
    Plug-Ins window:</p>

  <p><img width="245" height="269" alt="Plug-Ins Dialog"
    src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_plugins.png"/></p>

  <p>From this window, you can control which plug-ins for &brandShortName; can
    run. For example, if you don't like Flash animations in general but still
    find a need to have the plug-in installed, you can disable the plug-in
    here. This will block any Flash ads and animations until you enable the
    plug-in again.</p>

<h2 id="advanced_options">Advanced Options</h2>

  <p><img src="http://mozilla.org/projects/firefox/help/1.0rc1/opt_advanced.png"
    width="425" height="318" alt="Advanced Options Dialog"/></p>

  <p>The advanced panel contains many options that are less likely to be used
    by most people, but still useful and sometimes critical options for some
    people.</p>

  <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
  <p><em>Move system caret with focus/selection changes</em><br/>Specifies
    whether to move the system caret whenever the focus or selection changes.
    Some accessibility aids, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, use
    the system caret to determine which area of the screen to read or
    magnify.</p>

  <p><em>Use Find As You Type</em><br/>Find As You Type is a very useful
    feature in &brandShortName;. It is a fast way of finding links or text in
    a web page without the need of displaying complex search dialogs. Read
    more about Find As You Type at <a
    href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/typeaheadfind.html"
    target="_blank">mozilla.org</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="browsing">Browsing</h3>

  <p><em>Hide the tab bar when only one web site is open</em><br/>If you're
    only viewing one web page in a &brandShortName; window, the tab bar is not
    shown. Uncheck this option to always show the tab bar.</p>

  <p><em>Select new tabs opened from links</em><br/>When you middle-click on
    Web links (or hold down <em>Ctrl</em>  while clicking with the left mouse
    button), the links will be opened in a new tab. That tab will not be shown
    directly; it will be loaded in a background tab. Check this option to load
    the link in a foreground tab instead, which will show that tab
    directly.</p>

  <p><em>Warn when closing multiple tabs</em><br/>When you close a window with
    multiple tabs, &brandShortName; will ask you to confirm your choice.  This
    prevents you from accidentally closing the whole window when you wish to
    close only the current tab.  Uncheck this box to skip past the warning
    and have &brandShortName; automatically close the window.</p>

  <p><em>Use autoscrolling</em><br/>Autoscrolling is a useful feature which
    allows you to scroll the page by just holding down the middle mouse button
    (usually the scroll wheel) and move the mouse up or down. Some people find
    this annoying so here's the option for it.</p>

  <p><em>Use smooth scrolling</em><br/>Smooth scrolling is still somewhat
    experimental in &brandShortName;, but it can be very useful if you read a
    lot of long pages. Normally, when you press the Page Down key, the view
    jumps directly down one page. With Smooth Scrolling, it slides down more
    smoothly, so you are actually able to see how much it scrolls. This makes
    it easier to resume reading from where you were before.</p>

  <h3 id="multimedia">Multimedia</h3>

  <p><em>Resize large images to fit in the &brandShortName; window</em><br/>
  This feature is similar to the one seen in Internet Explorer. It makes
    images that are larger than can be fit on the screen shrink automatically
    so you can view the whole picture. Click on the image to view it at full
    size.</p>

  <h3 id="software_update">Software Update</h3>

  <p>&brandShortName; can check whether a new version of your installed
    extensions or of &brandShortName; itself is available.</p>

  <p><strong>&brandShortName;</strong><br/>
    By default, &brandShortName; will periodically check and notify you when a
    new version is available. Uncheck this option to disable the periodic
    check.</p>

  <p><strong>My Extensions</strong><br/>
    By default, &brandShortName; will periodically check and notify you when a
    new version for one of your installed extensions is available. Uncheck
    this option to disable the periodic check.</p>

  <p>Click the <em>Check Now</em> button to manually perform a check for
    updates to &brandShortName; and installed extensions.</p>

  <h3 id="security">Security</h3>

  <p><em>Use SSL 2.0</em><br/>Specifies whether you want to send and receive
    secured information through SSL2 (Secured Sockets Layer Level 2), the
    standard protocol for secure transmissions. All secure web sites support
    this protocol.</p>

  <p><em>Use SSL 3.0</em><br/>Specifies whether you want to send and receive
    secured information through SSL3 (Secured Sockets Layer Level 3), a
    protocol that is intended to be more secure than SSL2. Note that some web
    sites may not support this protocol.</p>

  <p><em>Use TLS 1.0</em><br/>Specifies whether you want to send and receive
    secured information through TLS (Transport Layer Security), an open
    security standard similar to SSL3 (Secure Sockets Layer). Note that some
    web sites may not support this protocol.</p>

  <h3 id="certificates">Certificates</h3>

  <p>Certificates help perform encryption and decryption of connections to
    <a href="glossary.xhtml#secure_site">secure sites</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Client Certificate Selection</em><br/>When a web site requests a
    secure connection, &brandShortName; will by default automatically use
    an appropriate certificate.  If you wish to manually choose a certificate
    (for example, if you wish to use a certain type of encryption instead of
    what is automatically selected), select the option "Ask Every Time" and
    you'll be in complete control of what certificates you use while
    browsing.</p>

  <p><em>Manage Certificates</em><br/>Click the <em>Manage Certificates...</em>
    button to view stored certificates, import new certificates, and
    back up or delete old certificates in &brandShortName;.</p>

  <p><em>Manage Security Devices</em><br/>Security devices can encrypt and
    decrypt connections and store certificates and passwords.  If you need
    to use a security device other than the one in &brandShortName; or need
    to change your master password, click the <em>Manage Security
    Devices...</em> button.</p>

  <h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>

  <p>Validation ensures that certificates used by &brandShortName; are not
    obsolete.</p>

  <p><em>CRL</em><br/>&brandShortName; can use CRLs (also known as Certificate
    Revocation Lists) to ensure that your certificates are not invalid.  If you
    need to add a CRL to &brandShortName; or wish to view information about CRLs
    you have installed, click the <em>Manage CRLs...</em> button.</p>

  <p><em>OCSP</em><br/>OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) is a way to
    validate your certificates every time they are viewed or used.
    &brandShortName; does not use OCSP by default, but if you want to enable it,
    you can do so here.  You will most likely only need to change this if your
    Internet environment requires it.</p>
