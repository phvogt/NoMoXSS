 * this is such a hack that i think it deserves a song

 *
 *                    Philosophers song
 *
 *
 *            Immanual Kant was a real pissant
 *              Who was very rarely stable
 *
 *            Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar
 *              Who could think you under the table
 *
 *            David Hume could out consume
 *              Schopenhauer and Hegel
 *
 *            And Wittgenstein was a beery swine
 *              Who was just as schloshed as Schlegel
 *
 *             There's nothing Nietzche couldn't teach ya
 *              'Bout the raising of the wrist
 *             Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed
 *
 *
 *            John Stuart Mill, of his own free will
 *              On half a pint of shandy was particularly ill
 *
 *           Plato they say, could stick it away
 *              Half a crate of whiskey every day
 *
 *            Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle
 *              Hobbes was fond of his dram
 *
 *            And Rene' Descartes was a drunken fart
 *              "I drink, therefore I am"
 *
 *             Yes, Socrates, himself, is particularly missed
 *               A lovely little thinker
 *             But a bugger when he's pissed
