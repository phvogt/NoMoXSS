 * New rules of reflow:
 * 1. you get a WillReflow() followed by a Reflow() followed by a DidReflow() in order
 *    (no separate pass over the tree)
 * 2. it's the parent frame's responsibility to size/position the child's view (not
 *    the child frame's responsibility as it is today) during reflow (and before
 *    sending the DidReflow() notification)
 * 3. positioning of child frames (and their views) is done on the way down the tree,
 *    and sizing of child frames (and their views) on the way back up
 * 4. if you move a frame (outside of the reflow process, or after reflowing it),
 *    then you must make sure that its view (or its child frame's views) are re-positioned
 *    as well. It's reasonable to not position the view until after all reflowing the
 *    entire line, for example, but the frame should still be positioned and sized (and
 *    the view sized) during the reflow (i.e., before sending the DidReflow() notification)
 * 5. the view system handles moving of widgets, i.e., it's not our problem
