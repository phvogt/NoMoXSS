<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="authentication">authentication</dt>
<dd>The use of a password, certificate, personal identification number
  (PIN), or other information to validate an identity over a computer
  network.</dd>

<dt id="bookmark">bookmark</dt>
<dd>A stored web page address (<a href="#Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a>)
  that you can go to easily by clicking a bookmark icon in the Bookmarks Toolbar
  or choosing the bookmark's name from the Bookmarks menu.</dd>

<dt id="Bookmarks_Toolbar">Bookmarks Toolbar</dt>
<dd>The customizable toolbar that appears just below the Location Bar by
  default in &brandShortName;. It contains buttons for your favorite bookmarks
  (or folders containing groups of bookmarks) that you can add or remove.</dd>

<dt id="cache">cache</dt>
<dd>A collection of web page copies stored on your computer's hard disk or in
  its random-access memory (RAM). &brandShortName; accumulates these copies as you
  browse the Web. When you click a link or type a
  <a href="#Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a> to fetch a particular web page for
  which the cache already contains a copy, &brandShortName; compares the cached copy
  to the original. If there have been no changes, &brandShortName; uses the cached
  copy rather than refetching the original, saving processing and download time.</dd>

<dt id="certificate">certificate</dt>
<dd>The digital equivalent of an ID card. A certificate specifies the name of an
  individual, company, or other entity and certifies that a public key, which
  is included in the certificate, belongs to that entity. When you digitally
  sign a message or other data, the digital signature for that message is
  created with the aid of the private key that corresponds to the public key
  in your certificate.</dd>

<dt id="cipher">cipher</dt>
<dd>See <a href="#cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</a>.</dd>

<dt id="client">client</dt>
<dd>Software (such as an Internet browser) that sends requests to and receives
  information from a <a href="#server">server</a>, which is usually running
  on a different computer. A computer on which client software runs is also
  described as a client.</dd>

<dt id="cookie">cookie</dt>
<dd>A small bit of information stored on your computer by some Web sites. When
  you visit such a site, the site asks &brandShortName; to place one or more cookies
  on your hard disk. Later, when you return to the site, &brandShortName; sends the
  site the cookies that belong to it. Cookies help Web sites keep track of
  information about you, such as the contents of your shopping cart. You can set
  your cookies options to control how cookies are used and how much information
  you are willing to let Web sites store on them. See also
  <a href="#foreign_cookie">foreign cookie</a>.</dd>

<dt id="Cookie_Manager">Cookie Manager</dt>
<dd>The part of &brandShortName; that you can use to control <a href="#cookie">cookies</a>.</dd>

<dt id="cryptographic_algorithm">cryptographic algorithm</dt>
<dd>A set of rules or directions used to perform cryptographic operations such
  as <a href="#encryption">encryption</a> and <a href="#decryption">decryption</a>.
  Sometimes called a <em>cipher</em>.</dd>

<dt id="cryptography">cryptography</dt>
<dd>The art and practice of scrambling (encrypting) and unscrambling (decrypting)
  information. For example, cryptographic techniques are used to scramble and unscramble
  information flowing between commercial web sites and &brandShortName;.</dd>

<dt id="decryption">decryption</dt>
<dd>The process of unscrambling data that has been encrypted. See also
  <a href="#encryption">encryption</a>.</dd>

<dt id="digital_ID">digital ID</dt>
<dd>See <a href="#certificate">certificate</a>.</dd>

<dt id="digital_signature">digital signature</dt>
<dd>A code created from both the data to be signed and the private key of the
  signer. This code is unique for each new piece of data. Even a single comma
  added to a message changes the digital signature for that message.
  Successful validation of your digital signature by appropriate software not
  only provides evidence that you approved the transaction or message but
  also provides evidence that the data has not changed since you digitally
  signed it. A digital signature has nothing to do with a handwritten signature,
  although it can sometimes be used for similar legal purposes.</dd>

<dt id="distinguished_name">distinguished name (DN)</dt>
<dd>A specially formatted name that uniquely identifies the subject of a
  certificate.</dd>

<dt id="eavesdropping">eavesdropping</dt>
<dd>Surreptitious interception of information sent over a network by an entity
  for whom the information is not intended.</dd>

<dt id="encryption">encryption</dt>
<dd>The process of scrambling information in a way that disguises its meaning.
  For example, encrypted connections between computers make it very difficult
  for third-parties to unscramble, or <em>decrypt,</em> information flowing
  over the connection. Encrypted information can be decrypted only by someone
  who possesses the appropriate key.</dd>

<dt id="XSLT">Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT)</dt>
<dd>A language used to convert an XML document into another XML document or into
  another format.</dd>

<dt id="XML">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</dt>
<dd>An open standard for describing data. Unlike HTML, XML allows the
  developer of a web page to define special tags. For more information,
  see the online W3C document <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">Extensible
  Markup Language (XML)</a>.</dd>

<dt id="feed">feed</dt>
<dd>An <a href="#XML">XML</a> web page that contains a list of links to
  other web pages.  Special programs can read feeds to create a list
  of headlines from the links, automatically updating the list as it changes.
  News web sites use feeds to quickly publish the latest headlines, and
  personal online journals often use feeds to quickly notify visitors about
  new entries.  See also <a href="#live_bookmark">live bookmark</a>.</dd>

<dt id="File_Transfer_Protocol">File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</dt>
<dd>A standard that allows users to transfer files from one computer to
  another over a network. You can use &brandShortName; to fetch files
  using FTP.</dd>

<dt id="FIPS_PUBS_140-1">FIPS PUBS 140-1</dt>
<dd>Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) 140-1 is
  a US government standard for implementations of cryptographic modules &mdash;
  hardware or software that encrypts and decrypts data or performs other
  cryptographic operations (such as creating or verifying digital signatures).
  Many products sold to the US government must comply with one or more of the
  FIPS standards.</dd>

<dt id="foreign_cookie">foreign cookie</dt>
<dd>A cookie from one site that gets stored on your computer when you visit a
  different site. Sometimes a web site displays content that is hosted on another
  Web site. That content can be anything from an image to text or an advertisement.
  The second Web site that hosts such elements also has the ability to store a
  cookie in &brandShortName;, even though you haven't visited it directly. Also known
  as &quot;third-party cookie.&quot;
</dd>

<dt id="Form_Manager">Form Manager</dt>
<dd>The part of &brandShortName; that can help you save the personal data you enter
  into online forms, such as your name, address, and phone number. Then, when
  a Web site presents you with a form, Form Manager can fill it in automatically.</dd>

<dt id="helper_application">helper application</dt>
<dd>Any application that is used to open or view a file downloaded by &brandShortName;.
  A <a href="#plug-in">plug-in</a> is a special kind of helper application that
  installs itself into the Plugins directory of the main &brandShortName; installation
  directory and can typically be opened within &brandShortName; itself. Microsoft Word,
  Adobe Photoshop, and other external applications are considered helper applications
  but not plug-ins, because they don't install themselves into the browser directory
  but can be opened from the download dialog box.</dd>

<dt id="home_page">home page</dt>
<dd>The page &brandShortName; is set to display every time you launch it or when you
  click the <em>Home</em> button. Also used to refer to the main page for a
  Web site from which you can explore the rest of the site.</dd>

<dt id="Hypertext_Markup_Language">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</dt>
<dd>The document format used for Web pages. The HTML standard defines tags, or
  codes, used to define the text layout, fonts, style, images, and other
  elements that make up a web page.</dd>

<dt id="implicit_consent">implicit consent</dt>
<dd>Also known as implied or &quot;opt-out&quot; consent. Used to describe
  privacy settings that may allow web sites to gather information about you
  (for example by means of <a href="#cookie">cookies</a> and online forms)
  unless you explicitly choose to withhold your consent by selecting an
  option on a page that the web site provides for that purpose. Your
  consent may not be requested when the information is actually gathered.</dd>

<dt id="IMAP_glossary">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</dt>
<dd>A standard mail server protocol that allows you to store all your messages
  and any changes to them on the server rather than on your computer's hard
  disk. Using IMAP rather than <a href="#POP_glossary">POP</a> saves disk space
  and allows you to access your entire mailbox, including sent mail, drafts, and
  custom folders, from any location. Using an IMAP server over a modem is generally
  faster than using a POP mail server, since you initially download message headers
  only. Not all ISPs support IMAP.</dd>

<dt id="Internet">Internet</dt>
<dd>A worldwide network of millions of computers that communicate with each
  other using standard protocols such as
  <a href="#Transmission_Control_Protocol_Internet_Protocol">TCP/IP</a>.
  Originally developed for the US military in 1969, the Internet grew to include
  educational and research institutions and, in the late 1990s, millions of
  businesses, organizations, and individuals. Today the Internet is used for email,
  browsing the <a href="#World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>, instant messaging,
  mailing lists and usegroups, and many other purposes.</dd>

<dt id="Internet_protocol_address">Internet protocol address (IP address)</dt>
<dd>The address of a computer on a
  <a href="#Transmission_Control_Protocol_Internet_Protocol">TCP/IP</a> network.
  Every computer on the Internet has an IP address. <a href="#client">Clients</a>
  have either a permanent IP address or one that is dynamically assigned to them
  each time they connect with the network.</dd>

<dt id="Java">Java</dt>
<dd>A programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. A single Java program
  can run on many different kinds of computers, thus avoiding the need for
  programmers to create a separate version of each program for each kind of
  computer. After Java is installed, &brandShortName; can automatically download
  and run Java programs (also called applets).</dd>

<dt id="JavaScript">JavaScript</dt>
<dd>A scripting language commonly used to construct web pages. Programmers use
  JavaScript to make web pages more interactive; JavaScript is often used to
  dynamically validate forms and select buttons. JavaScript can be used with
  Java, but it is technically a separate language. Java is not required for
  JavaScript to work correctly.</dd>

<dt id="LDAP_glossary">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</dt>
<dd>A standard protocol for accessing directory services, such as corporate
  address books, across multiple platforms.</dd>

<dt id="live_bookmark">live bookmark</dt>
<dd>A special type of bookmark that acts as a folder to contain the links in a
  <a href="#feed">feed</a>.  You can create a live bookmark by visiting a site
  with a feed, clicking on the live bookmark icon in the Status Bar, and
  selecting the feed format you wish to use.</dd>

<dt id="location_bar">Location Bar</dt>
<dd>The field (and associated buttons) near the top of a &brandShortName; window
  where you can type a <a href="#Uniform_Resource_Locator">URL</a> or search terms.</dd>

<dt id="master_password">master password</dt>
<dd>A password used to protect saved passwords and other private data.
  &brandShortName; will prompt you for your master password when you wish to
  access this data. If you have multiple security devices, each security device
  will require a separate master password.</dd>

<dt id="navigation_toolbar">Navigation Toolbar</dt>
<dd>The toolbar near the top of the &brandShortName; window that includes
  the <em>Back</em> and <em>Forward</em> buttons.</dd>

<dt id="object_signing">object signing</dt>
<dd>A technology that allows software developers to sign Java code, JavaScript
  scripts, or any kind of file, and that allows users to identify the signers
  and control access by signed code to local system resources.</dd>

<dt id="object-signing_certificate">object-signing certificate</dt>
<dd>A certificate whose corresponding private key is used to sign objects
  such as code files. See also <a href="#object_signing">object signing</a>.</dd>

<dt id="password-based_authentication">password-based authentication</dt>
<dd>Confident identification by means of a name and password. See also
  <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>.</dd>

<dt id="Password_Manager">Password Manager</dt>
<dd>The part of &brandShortName; that can help you remember some or all of
  your names and passwords by storing them on your computer's hard disk and
  entering them for you automatically when you visit such sites.</dd>

<dt id="PKCS_11">PKCS #11</dt>
<dd>The public-key cryptography standard that governs security devices such
  as smart cards.</dd>

<dt id="platform_for_privacy_preferences">Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P)</dt>
<dd>A standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) designed to
  help users to gain more control over the use of personal information by Web
  sites they visit. For general information on the standard itself, see the
  online document <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">P3P Public Overview</a>.</dd>

<dt id="plug-in">plug-in</dt>
<dd>A type of <a href="#helper_application">helper application</a> that
  adds new capabilities to &brandShortName;, such as the ability to play audio
  or video clips. Unlike other kinds of helper applications, a plug-in
  application installs itself into the Plugins directory within the main
  &brandShortName; installation directory and typically can be opened within
  &brandShortName; itself (internally). For example, an audio plug-in lets you
  listen to audio files on a web page or in an e-mail message. Macromedia
  Flash Player and Java are both examples of plug-in applications.</dd>

<dt id="POP_glossary">Post Office Protocol (POP)</dt>
<dd>A standard mail server protocol that requires you to download new
  messages to your local computer &mdash; although you can choose to leave
  copies on the server. With POP you can store all your messages (including
  sent mail, drafts, and custom folders) on one computer only. By contrast
  <a href="#IMAP_glossary">IMAP</a> allows you to permanently store all your
  messages and any changes to them on the server, where you can access them
  from any computer. Most ISPs currently support POP.</dd>

<dt id="private_key">private key</dt>
<dd>One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The private key is 
kept secret and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the 
corresponding public key.</dd>

<dt id="proxy">proxy</dt>
<dd>An intermediary or &quot;go-between&quot; program that acts as both a
  <a href="#server">server</a> and a <a href="#client">client</a> for
  the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients.</dd>

<dt id="search_engine">search engine</dt>
<dd>A web-based program that allows users to search for and retrieve
  specific information from the World Wide Web. The search engine may
  search the full text of web documents or a list of keywords; it may
  also use librarians who review web documents and index them manually
  for retrieval. Typically, the user types a word or phrase into a
  search box, and the search engine displays links to relevant web
  pages.</dd>

<dt id="secure_site">secure site</dt>
<dd>A site that uses <a href="#encryption">encryption</a> in connections
  with &brandShortName; to prevent other malicious Internet users from
  viewing transmitted data.  When you visit secure sites, &brandShortName;
  displays a lock icon in the <a href="#Status_Bar">Status Bar</a> and the
  <a href="#location_bar">Location Bar</a>.  &brandShortName; also
  displays the site's domain name in the Status Bar (to prevent malicious
  sites from stealing your data) and turns the background of the Location
  Bar to yellow.</dd>

<dt id="Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</dt>
<dd>A protocol that allows mutual authentication between a
  <a href="#client">client</a> and a <a href="#server">server</a>
  for the purpose of establishing an authenticated and encrypted
  connection. SSL runs above TCP/IP and below HTTP, LDAP, IMAP, NNTP,
  and other high-level network protocols. The new Internet Engineering
  Task Force (IETF) standard called Transport Layer Security (TLS) is
  based on SSL. See also <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>,
  <a href="#encryption">encryption</a>.</dd>

<dt id="server">server</dt>
<dd>Software (such as software that serves up web pages) that receives
  requests from and sends information to a <a href="#client">client</a>,
  which is usually running on a different computer. A computer on which
  server software runs is also described as a server.</dd>

<dt id="SSL">SSL</dt>
<dd>See <a href="#Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</a>.</dd>

<dt id="Status_Bar">Status Bar</dt>
<dd>The toolbar that appears at the bottom of any &brandShortName; window. It
  shows status icons on the right.</dd>

<dt id="Transmission_Control_Protocol_Internet_Protocol">Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</dt>
<dd>A Unix protocol used to connect computers running a variety of operating systems.
  TCP/IP is an essential Internet protocol and has become a global standard.</dd>

<dt id="Uniform_Resource_Locator">Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</dt>
<dd>The standardized address that tells &brandShortName; how to locate a file or
  other resource on the Web (for example, <tt>http://www.mozilla.org</tt>).
  Type URLs into &brandShortName;'s Location Bar to access web pages. URLs
  are also used in the links on web pages go to other web pages. Also known
  as an Internet or Web address.</dd>

<dt id="web_page">web page</dt>
<dd>A single document on the World Wide Web that is specified by a unique
  address or URL.  A web page may contain text, hyperlinks, and graphics.</dd>
