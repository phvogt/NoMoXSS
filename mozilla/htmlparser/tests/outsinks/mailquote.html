<body>

This page is a test of mail quoting.
<p>

I hope you will enjoy these quotes from <em>Hamlet</em>, introduced by a fairly long line to see how quotations get wrapped:
<p>

<blockquote type="cite">
<blockquote type="cite">
<em>(These have <b>br</b> tags after them.</em><br>
To be, or not to be, that is the question<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and fortunes of outrageous fortune<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, what a mind is here o'erthrown.<br>

<blockquote type="cite">
<em>(The next line does not end with a <b>br</b> tag.).</em><br>
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I.
</blockquote>

<em>(Neither does the next line:)</em></br>
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!

</blockquote>

<p>
Now we're outside all blockquotes.
